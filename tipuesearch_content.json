Whilst I was intrigued (I'm always looking for ways to engage my students) to the advantages they may offer towards the student experience and learning, I wasn't prepared to change my workflow to fit in to any specific format such technologies may prescribe: I generate HTML presentations using bookdown and don't use PowerPoint for example. I also didn't want to have to download any mobile application or worse, force my students to download anything (A UX nightmare for the classroom!) So over the 2019/20 christmas period, I developed a small web application to facilitate interactive sessions during my lectures. Hosted on the school's OpenStack platform, all I do is simply embed the page in an iframe using knitr and go from there. The students just point their device (phone, laptop, whatever) to a URL or use the generated QR code and they can instantly join (no login/codes required). My web development skills were rusty (haven't really done anything web based since late 2015) so it seemed like a good exercise and christmas was the only time I'd get to do it before the new teaching semester began. Having trialled it in the classroom, here are my initial observations: Students really liked it. Like a lot ! I was skeptical as I've heard the argument where its really just a digital ‘show of hands'. However, it really is more than that. For example, its easier to visualize in a bar chart a show of hands for a set of options rather than go through each in turn. Also, and here's where I think the magic lies and is worth further study, I can see how the show of hands changes over time . I have some ideas for how to study this in an experiment which I'll do at some point. Having my own system means I can discuss the internals of the system: this is useful when teaching a module like CM1202 . Students are also really interested in seeing how things work (especially first years) and I could create a welcoming environment for feedback where they can voice their opinions and suggest new features. Suggestions are one thing but when I can then go and implement their suggestions, and they see this in a future lecture (for example, the ‘Show Answer' utility was something I was unsure about at first but implemented it after an initial pilot at which point a student also thought it would be a good idea), students really appreciate it.

Here's the abstract: Historical narratives of conflict typically revolve around heroes and villains or perpetrators and victims. However, this dichotomy of events and people into good and evil greatly reduces the extent to which the past can be analysed, explained, and understood. To truly understand the actions that lead to conflict, one must appreciate the dense network of relationships between social agents, each with their own personal motivations and ideals. A contemporary political viewpoint capturing this multiperspectivity is that of Agonism. Focusing on the characters and events, Agonism emphasises the socio-cultural interactions and relationships between all agents involved including bystanders and, crucially, perpetrators. We discuss two ‘Games for a Social Change' that we have developed to promote an Agonistic view: Endless Blitz and Umschlag ‘43 . We describe the games themselves, and the framework of memory studies that informs our work. Here's a demo reel of both Endless Blitz and Umschlagplatz ‘43 in action!

Here's the abstract: This work presents a novel hand pose estimation framework via intermediate dense guidance map supervision. By leveraging the advantage of predicting heat maps of hand joints in detection-based methods, we propose to use dense feature maps through intermediate supervision in a regression-based framework that is not limited to the resolution of the heat map. Our dense feature maps are delicately designed to encode the hand geometry and the spatial relation between local joint and global hand. The proposed framework significantly improves the state-of-the-art in both 2D and 3D on the recent benchmark datasets. Xiaokun Wu wrote up an awesome post on the project on his website .

You can read the published article here . Below is the original unedited draft I wrote for those interested. Unedited Article Outside of entertainment, virtual reality ( VR ) has seen significant uptake in more practical domains. For example, using VR to piece together parts of a car engine to test out a look and feel before the manufacturing process. Or to try on the latest fashion accessory before you buy. Our own recent work at Bath has applied VR to exercise; imagine going to the gym to take part in the Tour de France and race against the world's top cyclists. While VR has been successful, it is not without its kinks. Designing an interactive system does not stop at the hardware and software; the human must be factored in too. Perception is the term for how we take information from the world and build understanding from it. Our perception of reality is what we base our decisions on, and mostly determines our sense of presence in an environment . So how to tackle the problem of designing VR systems that really transport us to new worlds with an acceptable sense of presence? As the scale of the problem grows, it becomes difficult to quantify the contribution each element of the experience makes to the person's sense of presence. For example, when watching a 360 film in VR , it is difficult to determine if the on screen animations contribute more or less than the 360 audio technology deployed in the experience. What we need is a method for studying VR in a reductionist manner; removing the clutter then adding piece by piece to observe the effect each has in turn. One theory blends together computer science and psychology: maximum likelihood estimation explains how we combine the information we receive across all our senses, integrating it together to inform our understanding of the environment. In its simplest form, it states that we combine sensory information in an optimal fashion; each sense contributes an estimate of the environment but it is noisy. This scenario is depicted in the figure below which shows how the estimates from our eyes and ears combine to give an optimal estimate somewhere in the middle. Note how the blue curve is slimmer than the other two showing decreased variance; the combined estimate takes the best of both worlds. It is also positioned between the two sensory estimates, showing a compromise of the two. Finally, note it is taller: this corresponds to a higher likelihood in its estimate. This has many applications in VR . Our recent work has applied this to solving a problem in VR with how people estimate distances. Imagine using a driving simulator for teaching people how to drive. If people compress distances in VR , then using it as a learning environment would be inappropriate. Understanding how people integrate information from their senses is crucial to VR because it is not solely visual. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a tool to model how effectively a VR system needs to render its multisensory environment in order to deliver the desired experience. Understanding perception will lead to more immersive VR experiences. It's not a matter of separating each signal from the noise; it's a matter of taking all signals with the noise to give the most likely result.","tags":"Articles","url":"https://ps2fino.github.io/the_conversation_march_2018.html","loc":"https://ps2fino.github.io/the_conversation_march_2018.html"},{"title":"New Publication @ CHI 2018!","text":"We've had a paper accepted at CHI 2018! Here's the abstract: One of the big challenges today is to keep people healthy through sufficient exercise. In this project we developed a new method for improving exercise performance in a motivating manner using a VR exergame. Players can work out on an exercycle doing high-intensity interval training while wearing a VR headset and racing in a virtual world. Our method is an interactive adaptation of Feedforward, a type of training used to achieve rapid improvements by creating self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. The game lets players compete against themselves, making it a bit harder for them so they are able to surpass their own previous performance. Our method helped players perform better and also have a better experience compared to racing against a virtual competitor.

I've experienced the ups and downs, the observed PhD curve and I've grown a lot. The biggest thing I've learned though, over the past 4 years, is about research attitudes. Knowing that there are unknown unknowns and having the humility to accept that. When I began my research, I felt overwhelmed: I tried and tried to review fields and areas where ‘more research was needed' to no avail. I became frustrated, anxious, and felt hopelessly lost in a sea of ‘potential areas of interest' and began questioning my own ability. Not from the healthy perspective; questions like \"Am I right?\" Or \"What if there is another way?\" These are good questions, and fall under my \"humility\" heading. Instead, I was asking \"Can I do this?\" and \"How do I know where to begin?\" I recently completed an application for an RA position at Bath , and when I was writing my personal statement, I thought about my own approach to my research and realised that an interesting theory applied…. The Big Five How would you describe personality? Sure, you can to great lengths, with use of colorful adjectives and poetic prose to describe personality. This is great if you're writing a book, or a reference for someone, but scientifically its way too much. Its difficult to compare and discuss personalities from a scientific point of view with such a high dimensionality or degrees of freedom . Rather, some clever psychologists attempted to reduce this dimensionality to a set of 5 core traits, and claimed that personality can be described by plotting across these five dimensions. Sometimes called the OCEAN model (scientists love acronyms, especially when those acronyms equate to actual words with ambigiously related semantics to what the acronym itself represents), it is widely applicable to many domains, and is useful as a measurement tool of personality. Once you can measure something, you can cluster data into categories, and then develop around these clusters. From a HCI perspective, one of the most novel applications I've come across of the OCEAN theory is the thory applied to gamers (i.e people who play games often). Jason Vandenburghe gave a talk at the 2014 CHIPlay conference in Toronto. Sadly I wasn't at the talk, but I'd seen Vandenburghe's earlier GDC talk in 2012. Vandenburghe applies OCEAN as a way of modelling player behaviour and their expectations from a game. The gist is that, if you can identify personality traits of players, for example those who are more open to exploration versus those who are more introverted, perhaps less keen on direct competition, you can adjust the game mechanics and dynamics to suit that player. Obviously, this is of direct interest to the games industry, and is useful for game designers to take into consideration. In my personal statement, I applied OCEAN to a PhD candidate, explaining the sides of the spectrum I feel a good candidate would lie. You can read my statement here , but I'll elaborate on my choices here. I've also kept them discipline agnostic; while I'm sure this can be further refined to fit specific disciplines (a model is a model though; always be weary of overfitting ), I've opted to keep things general. These are qualities of traits I feel any PhD student should possess. An OCEAN PhD I guess at this point, I should probably elaborate a bit on the OCEAN dimensions. The first, Openness relates to a person's apetite for new experiences. Rather than sticking to what works, a good PhD candidate is someone who embraces new opportunities and experiences, open to failure and a tenacity to take risks. A PhD is ultimately about learning how to deal with failure. All the paper rejections, deadlines missed for various reasons, and feelings of complete inability to complete anything is part of the learning process. My advisor said to me \"There'll always be another deadline\". It took me a while to fully appreciate the gravity of that sentence. It wasn't just to pick me up, but to really drill home the notion of research as an endless cycle. There will always be unknown unknowns, therefore there'll always be more research to do. If theres always more research to do, there'll always be another conference venue or journal deadline. The second trait is Conscientousness. This relates to ones ability to be resourceful and self sustainable. Professor Philip Willis once sent a departmental email around about how in the US they use the term PhD ‘advisor' rather than the term used in the UK and Ireland, ‘supervisor'. This stuck with me as I really saw it as a more appropriate term. A PhD should not require supervision; when you apply for a PhD in computer graphics, I would assume you have working knowledge of vector math and some experience with practical rendering techniques in theory and code. The same applies for any discipline be it music, geography, history, politics. The point is that this is already assumed: I would expect you to be capable of studying and working without supervision. However, at time what you will need is guidance. You may strike a mental wall in your research. Advice in the form of guidance is more effective here, perhaps suggesting related avenues that you may have overlooked, or indirect research areas that, with a bit of creative thinking, may lead to breakthrough methods just waiting to be applied to your research. Up next is Extraversion. A PhD student needs to be extraverted. Gone are the days of solo PhD theses; massive texts stuffed full of secluded work done in a lab or an office over the course of 3 years. The world has shifted, with globalisation catapulting us into the age of fast communication of ideas, and an ever expanding space of research domains opening up. Its impossible to do good research alone. Yes, I understand that a PhD is your work, but that work is done in a context of people, other disciplines, and more and more information on a daily basis. Some people even consider doing a PhD is irrelevant . My point here is that, tying in with Openness, a good PhD is someone who embraces methods and approaches from related research fields, and adopts an extraverted mind in approaching skill development. Complex problems in your field may only be complex because the right tools either do not exist, or do exist, but are applied in other disciplines where they also are approriate. Be adventurous! Agreeablenss is an interesting one, as a good PhD is somewhere in the middle. You should agree with data that opposes your initial hypotheses and beliefs, as painful as it may be to swallow. However, this does not mean you do so blindly. Ask why this data is the way it is? What does it mean for your hypothesis? Is it wrong, or just misguided? How can you learn from it? What if your hypothesis was originally based upon previous studies, a la Bayes Theorem ? Following Bayes logic, new information should not alter your view so much if you already have a substantial background in the opposing direction. The point here is to take in this new information, reflect on it, and then feed it back in to your new thinking. Finally, we have Neuroticism. I'm not saying a good PhD is a never neurotic; you'd have to be a sociopath to not feel upset at times during the course of your PhD. However, it is important to constantly reflect on your situation and understand that it is a bump in the road, not a road block. Remain calm in the face of opposition. Rather than a fit of hysteria, react to oppposition in a way that is productive. Process it, then fire some questions back at it. Don't take it at face value, but rather assimilate it and refine it. You may find that what was initially the polar opposite may actually only have issue with certain aspects of your standpoint. Be dynamic and invite opposition. It'll make your PhD richer in the end.","tags":"General Entry","url":"https://ps2fino.github.io/next-steps.html","loc":"https://ps2fino.github.io/next-steps.html"},{"title":"The Simpsons & their Mathematical Secrets","text":"I recently finished reading Simon Singh ‘s book titled ‘The Simpsons & their Mathematical Secrets' and thought I'd write a review as it was a riveting literary account of the history of mathematics, as told through personal interviews with the writing team of both ‘The Simpsons' & ‘Futurama'. The book does not demand extensive knowledge nor professional ability and grasp at Mathematics; instead it actually illuminates some of the more difficult problems, translating them into understandable language. Synopsis The book details how ‘The Simpsons' has spent the past 3 decades sneakily including some nontrivial mathematics within its episodes; the reason seemingly being that the writers felt it was humourous and would engage the more mathematically inclined viewers. Singh talks about how some episodes contain what is known as ‘Freeze Frame' gags, where the visual joke appears for less than 5 frames, forcing interested parties to pause the video playback to view it. However, other episodes place the maths in full view of the audience, in what appears to be random numbers or equations. However, upon further investigation it can be shown that the symbols and equations in episodes are far from meaningless combinations. One of my personal favorites is as Singh describes an episode of ‘Futurama' where Bender, a talking, drunken android protagonist sees a random binary sequency written in blood. Paying homage to that scene in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining', He then sees the reversed sequence through a mirror and is horrified!! Only those with some knowledge of binary number representation would appreciate this joke; read the book to find out more! Singh introduces many famous figures in the world of mathematics throughout the book. He spans centuries of history, from Archimedes to Euler , from Gauss to Germain , and right up to Ramanujan and Erdős (he even throws in a reference to Bill Gates of Microsoft fame and his one and only published academic paper). Some chapters are dedicated to individual mathematicians, using their achievements as a narrative, and introducing some of the problems they commited their lives too. With each new mathematician, Singh demonstrates his ability for morphing mathematics from what can be (for most people I presume) a difficult thing to understand into intuitive, clear and sometimes beautiful explanations about one of the worlds truly fascinating subjects. Engagement The book reignited an old passion in me for mathematics. Having strayed from the discipline for quite some time (I developed a paralyzing fear of maths during my undergraduate studies at University after having loved the subject and performed reasonably well during highschool), I found Singh to phrase the theorems in the book in such a way that they weren't terrifying any longer. Instead, the mathematics is juxtaposed with music, paintings, and other forms of art. It is clear from the outset that Singh believed mathematics deserves a place in this exclusive domain and does in fact state this explicitly though a quote from Keith Devlin regarding the degree to which Euler's equation reaches into the ‘very depths of existence'. Singh cleverly strays from deep technical derivations of some of the more complex topics within the main body of the book, opting to include them as appendices at the end. This avoids a context switch from consuming some fascinating history to remembering group theory, fractals, and prime numbers. This fits every reader from the casually piqued to the mathematics finatics obsessed with the underlying theory to satisfy their thirst for some proofs. After all, this book is really more of a historical passage through the catacombs of modern mathematics as opposed to a university freshman textbook on linear algebra. I found the book grossly engaging; I couldn't put it down and gorged upon its satisfactory ~250 pages in a weekend. Verdict I really enjoyed the book (as I imagine is quite obvious from my excited tone). Not only did I enjoy reading about the people behind the shows, my view of the Simpsons as a ‘dumb' tv show has been radically altered. I have developed a new found appreciation for it (indeed, I'll be looking for some Freeze Frame gags myself over the next few months in re-runs!), and also some of the issues I've had with mathematics since my undergraduate years have been lifted. I feel more confident and open to reading about mathematics again. In a way this book has truly illuminated my bleak view on the subject. What more can I say other than; GO READ IT ! :-)","tags":"Book Reviews","url":"https://ps2fino.github.io/simpsons-maths.html","loc":"https://ps2fino.github.io/simpsons-maths.html"},{"title":"Rendering spatial audio on a desktop: The SSR and APF libraries","text":"I've been playing around with the SSR library in order to render a binaural soundscape for a project I'm working on. Whilst a great library, I struggled to get to grips with it for a few days. The library makes heavy use of templates (a powerful paradigm of C++ but can be awkward to read) and is written using some design patterns I had never encountered before. I started by reading some of the source code, trying to compile the header-only library and get some test code working. After spending hours getting the library to compile, I was ready to try it out with some sample assets from Audio Defence . Compiler errors began to arise upon simply instantiating the ssr::BinauralRenderer so I had to dig a little deeper. I had a read of the source code and I came across some examples that were included in the repository. I also emailed one of the author's of the library to ask for some help with integrating the SSR as a library into my existing framework in order to handle the binaural rendering. After a week of bashing my head against the wall, I've now managed to pump out some spatial sound from the renderer, sending it out to the speakers and dumping it to a stereo file. I've decided to jot down some notes here to help me remember how the thing works!! The ssr::BinauralRenderer is a subclass of the apf::MimoProcessor, which is an abstract multiple input/multiple output processor that enables the programmer to implement the processing callback while handling the threading and access control of the samples held in the processor's buffer. The renderer is instantiated by passing a apf::paramter_map instance which is a key-value dictionary of configuration settings for the renderer. The main settings required are the sample rate, block size and the location (full path) to the HRIR file that contains the impulse responses for convoluion. The processor functions through use of the Policy Design Pattern . This design pattern dictates that a can have a number of different policies for responding to similar situations (ie. a class may have a number of different policies regarding the printing of data to a file or to a TCP stream). In my case, the policies that the renderer is concerned with are its interface (how to process it's data buffers at each audio cycle or rather how to ‘use' and interface with it) and how to act in a threaded manner. To specify which policies to use, you simply include the header file of the policy and define a macro called APF_MIMOPROCESSOR_INTERFACE_POLICY for the interface policy and APF_MIMOPROCESSOR_THREAD_POLICY for the thread policy. The library comes with a default thread header which just uses a single threaded policy (ie. not implemented) on windows and the POSIX library for *nix and OSX systems. In order to use the binaural rendererer, you need to specify the policies you want to use. The renderer relies on two policies in it's implementation; an interface policy and a threading policy. To use the renderer as a standalone module, the pointer policy must be used. This then opens up the audioCallback function to be called manually by the application programmer when they want to process some data. The function accepts 3 arguments, the block size of the frame to be processed, a pointer to a series of inputs and a pointer to a pair of outputs (as the binaural renderer is an instance of an N-input, 2-output processor for stereo binaural output). The processor requires it's input to be a pointer to a list of channels. These channels can be implemented as a series of vectors. The renderer's output is also expected to be a series of vectors representing the audio channels. The inputs should be a N * BLOCK_SIZE matrix where BLOCK_SIZE is the number of frames to be processed as a block during each run of the audio cycle. The N is the number of channels in the input. The outputs should be a 2 * BLOCK_SIZE matrix, indicating stereo output. The renderer expects a 1-1 mapping of input channels to sources, and the sources are ordered with the channels (ie Channels[0] is the first source, Channels[1] the second etc…) Finally, for dumping to a file, you need to transpose the channels as libsndfile reads in row-wise order, intereleaving the channels as it dumps to the file. This was the major source of confusion for me and it took some fiddling and multiple reads of the source repo to understand how that worked. So to recap; the binaural renderer can be instantiated after specifying the policies required to do it's thing. Next you need to generate a parameter map, a key-value dictionary containing the configuration (block size, HRIR file path etc.) for the renderer. In order to use the renderer, you pass a pointer to a list of arrays representing the channels of the audio (best to use the apf::fixed_matrix container that comes with the APF framework). A blunder was in dumping the output to a file; this wasn't the SSR 's fault as libsndfile expects reads and writes in row wise order for (de)interleaving. All I had to do here is have a second output buffer which is the transposed matrix of the output list of channels. You can then call the writef() function of the SndFileHandle object in the libsndfile C++ API for writing stereo output to the file. Having figured all of this out I can finally move onto the image processing aspect of my project. More on this to come later.","tags":"Technology","url":"https://ps2fino.github.io/ssr.html","loc":"https://ps2fino.github.io/ssr.html"},{"title":"Auditory saliency and its role in accessible gaming","text":"Today I met with my supervisors to discuss my upcoming transfer viva and interesting topics for studies moving into 2015. While nearing completion, my supervisors gave some valuable feedback for the tone and message of my report; especially the necessity of a coherent narrative. I've tried to be as thorough as possible in my report writing but I need to make sure that the reason for reading it is conveyed clearly to the reader. After discussing the report we moved on to the interesting stuff; what to start working on next. The overarching theme of my thesis is inclusive gaming. By this, I am interested in design techniques and technologies that can enable games to reach a wider audience by becoming artefacts of an accessible design. How can an interface surpass the status quo and becoming \"accessible\" whilst maintaining the same level of efficiency as one for sighted players? Given that our aural senses have a much smaller capacity for interpreting information when compared to our visual sense, this sounds like it is unachievable. However, a lot of the information our visual sense perceives in the occipital lobe and propogates through the visual cortex is redundant, irrelevant. Most of the time, there is a subset of the data perceived that is of interest or rather necessary to understand the scene which we are observing. In other words, what we want is salience. Whilst current accessible tools focus on mapping visual elements 1-1 to an equal yet slower modality (temporality issues exist in screen readers and text-to-speech systems), might there be a way to extract the information in a visual scene, remove non-salient information and then compress it into a form that enables a ~1:1 mapping of the objects in the scene and the sounds used to represent them? Back to the books for me. Below are references shared with me by my supervisor. Passing them on here.

I've decided to have a bash at it and might try and publish to it at least once a week, probably on a Sunday afternoon ( much like this one :-) ). I've often tried blogging in the past but could never quite do it. I've found it uncomfortable, difficult or frustrating in the past to write things down in a public format as I've always kept notes in the past. I've been thinking however that this maintaining a blog might be a good idea for my EngD as it will certainly help build up a corpus of writing which may prove useful in two years time when it comes to the viva. This past year has seen a lot happen in my academic life. Highlights include: UBISS Taking part in the 5th UBI Summer School in Oulu (link UBISS ), where my team took home the best project award from Workshop D. The workshop was given by Dr. Floyd Mueller from RMIT in Melbourne, Australia. The workshop involved exploring the design of physical based games that incorporate digital technology in some form. Dr. Mueller has a nicer terminology; ‘Bodily Play'. The school proved an indispensable week full of activities from learning interesting research in physical gaming as well as meeting many students from around the world studying STEM disciplines. The best part was that the game I created with my team, Reindeer & Wolves, was published as a short paper at the CHI PLAY conference in Toronto. There is a QR code at the bottom of this page with a DOI embedded for the article. Audio Defence Winning the accessibility award at the TIGA Games Industry Awards in London. The ceremony took place in November and a game I have worked on the past year with my partner company, Somethin' Else , won the Accessibility award. We were delighted to have won the award in recognition of the work we've been doing over the past year. The game is a first person shooter where the enemies (or shoot-ies) are rendered binaurally for a 3D spatial effect in real time. The game is available on the App Store here . As I approach the end of the year, I am prepping for my transfer report and viva. This I hope will go smoothly as I want to demonstrate the work I've done so far as well as pose a structured plan for the next 2 years. I'll write my next post next week. So for now, I'm signing off.","tags":"General Entry","url":"https://ps2fino.github.io/first-post.html","loc":"https://ps2fino.github.io/first-post.html"}]}
