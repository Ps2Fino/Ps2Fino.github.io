Here&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasonic mid-air haptic technologies, which provide haptic feedback through airwaves produced using ultrasound, could be
employed to investigate the sense of body ownership and immersion in virtual reality (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt;) by inducing the virtual hand illusion (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VHI&lt;/span&gt;).
Ultrasonic mid-air haptic perception has solely been investigated for glabrous (hairless) skin, which has higher tactile sensitivity than hairy skin.
In contrast, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VHI&lt;/span&gt; paradigm typically targets hairy skin without comparisons to glabrous skin.
The aim of this paper was to investigate illusory body ownership, the applicability of ultrasonic mid-air haptics, and perceived immersion in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt; using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VHI&lt;/span&gt;.
Fifty participants viewed a virtual hand being stroked by a feather synchronously and asynchronously with the ultrasonic stimulation applied to the glabrous skin on the palmar surface and the hairy skin on the dorsal surface of their hands.
Questionnaire responses revealed that synchronous stimulation induced a stronger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VHI&lt;/span&gt; than asynchronous stimulation.
In synchronous conditions, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VHI&lt;/span&gt; was stronger for palmar stimulation than dorsal stimulation.
The ultrasonic stimulation was also perceived as more intense on the palmar surface compared to the dorsal surface.
Perceived immersion was not related to illusory body ownership per se but was enhanced by the provision of synchronous&amp;nbsp;stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a boom in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality technologies which have been widely adopted both by the consumer market and the research community. 
These technologies have provided researchers the ability to generate and gather data in new ways, through world building and scenario creation in every environment imagined. 
Although this growing interest is exciting, there is also a mounting concern about best practises and ethical dilemmas. 
In the literature one can already find a large quantity of papers providing guidelines and raising ethical concerns. 
However, ethical pitfalls continue to be overlooked. 
In this opinion paper, prompted by the ethics developments in Artificial Intelligence (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;), another area with rapid growth and adoption which has been overwhelmed by a huge number of guidelines and is still nowhere close to universal acceptance of standards, we propose that the virtual, augmented, and mixed reality research and development areas need to come together as whole; involving government, industry and science in order to define, develop and decide guidelines and strategies before we replicate the devastating consequences such as decaying trust in technology witnessed in other areas like social&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility in sports media broadcast (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt;) remains a problem for blind spectators who wish to socialize and watch sports with friends and family.
Although popular, radio&amp;#8217;s reliance on low bandwidth speech results in an overwhelming experience for blind spectators.
In this paper we focused on two core issues: (i) how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt; can be augmented to convey diegetic information more effectively, and (ii) the social context in which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt; are consumed.
We chose tennis broadcasts for our investigations.
Addressing issue (i), we developed a system design and prototype to enhance the experience of watching tennis matches, focusing on blind spectators using audio descriptions and 3D audio, and evaluated our system with (n=12) in a controlled user evaluation.
Our results indicate how audio descriptions gave clear information for the tennis ball placements, 3D audio provided subtle cues for the ball direction, and radio provided desired human commentary.
For issue (ii), we conducted an online questionnaire (n=15) investigating the social context in which blind spectators consume &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt;. 
Participant feedback indicated there is a demand for more accessible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt; content such that people can consume &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt; by themselves and with their friends.
Participants were enthusiastic for a revised system design mixing elements from 3D audio and audio description.
We discuss our results in the context of social &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt; spectatorship, concluding with insights into accessible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
