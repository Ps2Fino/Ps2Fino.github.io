&lt;p&gt;Current trends in gerontology conceptualize Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool for rehabilitation, lauding its potential for cognitive rehabilitation or as an intervention to reduce cognitive function decline (D'Cunha, et al., 2019) (Bauer &amp;amp; Andringa, 2020) (Sayma, Tuijt, Cooper, &amp;amp; Walters, 2020) (Moyle, Jones, Dwan, &amp;amp; Petrovich, 2018). 
However, we must take a critical stance and identify not just the potential positive impact, but also how things may go wrong without appropriate guidelines, and the need for careful design around the interaction affordances of the technology.
We conducted co-discovery and co-design workshops involving expert stakeholders and older adults (N=20) over a period of 6 month, involving practical activities including user personas and focus groups to understand the complexities of loneliness and identify possible solutions with VR.
Based on our findings we focus our argument on two key factors in the conceptualization of loneliness: spaces, and activities which may take place within said spaces. 
We present our reconceptualization of VR as a tool for group activities instead of passive consumption of content and make a first step suggestions to the community for reducing feelings of loneliness with VR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultrasonic mid-air haptic technologies, which provide haptic feedback through airwaves produced using ultrasound, could be
employed to investigate the sense of body ownership and immersion in virtual reality (VR) by inducing the virtual hand illusion (VHI).
Ultrasonic mid-air haptic perception has solely been investigated for glabrous (hairless) skin, which has higher tactile sensitivity than hairy skin.
In contrast, the VHI paradigm typically targets hairy skin without comparisons to glabrous skin.
The aim of this paper was to investigate illusory body ownership, the applicability of ultrasonic mid-air haptics, and perceived immersion in VR using the VHI.
Fifty participants viewed a virtual hand being stroked by a feather synchronously and asynchronously with the ultrasonic stimulation applied to the glabrous skin on the palmar surface and the hairy skin on the dorsal surface of their hands.
Questionnaire responses revealed that synchronous stimulation induced a stronger VHI than asynchronous stimulation.
In synchronous conditions, the VHI was stronger for palmar stimulation than dorsal stimulation.
The ultrasonic stimulation was also perceived as more intense on the palmar surface compared to the dorsal surface.
Perceived immersion was not related to illusory body ownership per se but was enhanced by the provision of synchronous stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen a boom in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality technologies which have been widely adopted both by the consumer market and the research community. 
These technologies have provided researchers the ability to generate and gather data in new ways, through world building and scenario creation in every environment imagined. 
Although this growing interest is exciting, there is also a mounting concern about best practises and ethical dilemmas. 
In the literature one can already find a large quantity of papers providing guidelines and raising ethical concerns. 
However, ethical pitfalls continue to be overlooked. 
In this opinion paper, prompted by the ethics developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), another area with rapid growth and adoption which has been overwhelmed by a huge number of guidelines and is still nowhere close to universal acceptance of standards, we propose that the virtual, augmented, and mixed reality research and development areas need to come together as whole; involving government, industry and science in order to define, develop and decide guidelines and strategies before we replicate the devastating consequences such as decaying trust in technology witnessed in other areas like social media.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility in sports media broadcast (SMB) remains a problem for blind spectators who wish to socialize and watch sports with friends and family.
Although popular, radio's reliance on low bandwidth speech results in an overwhelming experience for blind spectators.
In this paper we focused on two core issues: (i) how SMB can be augmented to convey diegetic information more effectively, and (ii) the social context in which SMB are consumed.
We chose tennis broadcasts for our investigations.
Addressing issue (i), we developed a system design and prototype to enhance the experience of watching tennis matches, focusing on blind spectators using audio descriptions and 3D audio, and evaluated our system with (n=12) in a controlled user evaluation.
Our results indicate how audio descriptions gave clear information for the tennis ball placements, 3D audio provided subtle cues for the ball direction, and radio provided desired human commentary.
For issue (ii), we conducted an online questionnaire (n=15) investigating the social context in which blind spectators consume SMB. 
Participant feedback indicated there is a demand for more accessible SMB content such that people can consume SMB by themselves and with their friends.
Participants were enthusiastic for a revised system design mixing elements from 3D audio and audio description.
We discuss our results in the context of social SMB spectatorship, concluding with insights into accessible SMB technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper is an analysis of 2 games we made as part of the EU Horizon 2020 UNREST project.
We &lt;a href="https://ps2fino.github.io/chiplay-2018.html"&gt;previously wrote&lt;/a&gt; (descriptively) about the games, but this paper is a comprehensive study on our installation at the Ruhr Museum, considering reactions from museum visitors and the like.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to discuss what we define as Agonistic Games: serious games which explore the theme of agonism.
Here's the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose Agonistic Games (AGs) as a serious games subcategory that can stimulate critical reflection on topics of dark heritage through multiperspectivity and unsettling play.
We first discuss the emerging topic of agonism in memory studies, and then how games can be used to support its objectives.
We then discuss the development of 2 original AGs: Endless Blitz and Umschlagplatz '43. 
We explore whether these two AGs were perceived as capable of stimulating critical reflection by collecting data from visitors to the exhibition 'Krieg. Macht. Sinn' at the Ruhr Museum in Germany where the games were installed, and from participants in an online course describing the games.
From analysing data collected, we outline four factors inhibiting the capacity of AGs to stimulate critical reflection (topic, context, design, and assumptions about games) and propose strategies for overcoming these inhibitors. 
Our findings are valuable to scholars, game researchers, and designers, strengthening the foundations for the design and development of future AGs.investigation to inform the design of effective remote-learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive Open Online Courses are a dominant force in remote-learning yet suffer from persisting problems stemming from lack of commitment and low completion rates. 
In this initial study we investigate how the use of immersive virtual environments for Power-Point based informational learning may benefit learners and mimic traditional lectures successfully. 
We examine the role of embodied agent tutors which are frequently implemented within virtual learning environments. 
We find similar performance on a bespoke knowledge test and metrics for motivation, satisfaction, and engagement by learners in both real and virtual environments, regardless of embodied agent tutor presence. 
Our results raise questions regarding the viability of using virtual environments for remote-learning paradigms, and we emphasise  the need for further investigation to inform the design of effective remote-learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game Jams are planned events in which attendees engage in practices of co-creation in an attempt to devise a game concept and prototype. 
They are designed to be fun, participatory, and stimulate creativity over a short intense period of time.
We report on a recent Game Jam, &lt;em&gt;Sacred Spring&lt;/em&gt;, aimed at educating children on the medical and scientific history of the Roman Baths in the city of Bath, UK.
In this paper, we describe the event and its output, with some brief discussion on what we learned from organizing and running the game jam with a group of children aged 6-9 years old.
Our aim is to discuss our Game Jam with the inclusive participatory design (PD) community, contextualizing novel game design and game play based learning strategies in the PD space, and devising ways to reach a broader audience in future workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical narratives of conflict typically revolve around heroes and villains or perpetrators and victims.
However, this dichotomy of events and people into good and evil greatly reduces the extent to which the past can be analysed, explained, and understood.
To truly understand the actions that lead to conflict, one must appreciate the dense network of relationships between social agents, each with their own personal motivations and ideals.
A contemporary political viewpoint capturing this multiperspectivity is that of Agonism.
Focusing on the characters and events, Agonism emphasises the socio-cultural interactions and relationships between all agents involved including bystanders and, crucially, perpetrators. 
We discuss two 'Games for a Social Change' that we have developed to promote an Agonistic view: &lt;em&gt;Endless Blitz&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Umschlag '43&lt;/em&gt;.
We describe the games themselves, and the framework of memory studies that informs our work.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work presents a novel hand pose estimation framework via intermediate dense guidance map supervision. 
By leveraging the advantage of predicting heat maps of hand joints in detection-based methods, we propose to use dense feature maps through intermediate supervision in a regression-based framework that is not limited to the resolution of the heat map. 
Our dense feature maps are delicately designed to encode the hand geometry and the spatial relation between local joint and global hand. 
The proposed framework significantly improves the state-of-the-art in both 2D and 3D on the recent benchmark datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big challenges today is to keep people healthy through sufficient exercise. 
In this project we developed a new method for improving exercise performance in a motivating manner using a VR exergame.
Players can work out on an exercycle doing high-intensity interval training while wearing a VR headset and racing in a virtual world. 
Our method is an interactive adaptation of Feedforward, a type of training used to achieve rapid improvements by creating self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. 
The game lets players compete against themselves, making it a bit harder for them so they are able to surpass their own previous performance. 
Our method helped players perform better and also have a better experience compared to racing against a virtual competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of the work, and you can follow the the &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/research-centres/reality-and-virtual-environments-augmentation-labs-reveal/"&gt;ReVEaL&lt;/a&gt; to see more about what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
